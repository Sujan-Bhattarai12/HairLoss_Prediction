# HairLoss_Prediction

The analysis involves using hair data available from Datacamp. Initially steps is to clean the data, perform exploratory visulizations, and make the necessary changes. The projec is a part of global competition which will be submitted next month in the end of October.

Brief summary of my analysis:
- Machine learning:
A classification model can be built to predict whether an individual will suffer from hair loss based on given factors.
Use cluster analysis to explore whether there are different types of hair loss groups in the data set.
Use algorithms such as decision trees or random forests to identify the key factors that best predict hair loss.
